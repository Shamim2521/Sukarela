<p >
 Established in 19 Feb 2018. Our team is planning to create a nonprofit
organization that will unite all the NGOs around Malaysia who wants to
promote their volunteerism activities in a website. Our mission is to be
the ultimate charity platform of choice to connect all the NGOs around,
volunteers, and beneficiaries with the end result being making charitable
giving a part of everyone’s life. We aim to provide assistance to our
beneficiaries in two key aspects, in the form of financial aid as well as
emotional support to enable them to be self-sustained at the end of our
support.

As Malaysia continues to develop, and as the world around us changes,
we will increasingly need innovative thinking and socially customized
volunteers for solutions to address complex services an events. Through
this website we support partner organization operating within our focus
areas because we want to go beyond not just a funding support
organization website but also to extend our partnership to worldwide.
This is a role closely aligned to our strategic priority in effecting long
term social impact.
